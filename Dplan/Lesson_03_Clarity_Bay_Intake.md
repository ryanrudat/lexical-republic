- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/Script_Writing_Style_Guide.md`

## 1) Weekly Outcomes
By the end of this class, students can:
- Ask for clarification politely before approving unclear content.
- Use `can/should` to explain priority decisions.
- Use these new words in context: `clarify`, `queue`, `priority`, `dispatch`.

## 2) Semester Outcomes Supported
- Outcome 1: identify intent from official language.
- Outcome 2: apply modal + imperative structures accurately.
- Outcome 3: reuse new words in speaking/writing.
- Outcome 4: justify one processing decision with evidence.

## 3) Story Outcomes
- Workload increases; speed pressure becomes visible.
- Ivan warns that fast output can hide mistakes.
- Students feel the tension between quota and truth.

## 4) Character Direction (canon)
- PEARL: optimistic productivity framing.
- Betty: encouraging pace and confidence.
- Ivan: caution + anxiety, still loyal but uneasy.

## 5) Vocabulary + Grammar Lock
- Known words: `help`, `question`, `line`, `message`
- New words: `clarify`, `queue`, `priority`, `dispatch`
- Grammar focus:
  - modal `can/should`
  - imperative process language
  - polite clarification frame: "Could you clarify...?"

## 6) In-Class Required Flow (50 min)
1. 0-5 min: Shift Start + phrase pre-teach
2. 5-11 min: Broadcast Clip A
3. 11-19 min: Briefing checks (3)
4. 19-30 min: Core Practice (Language Lab decisions)
5. 30-36 min: Broadcast Clip B
6. 36-46 min: Production (Voice Booth OR Filing Desk)
7. 46-50 min: Clock-Out + exit ticket

Optional if time: mini Harmony batch (2 posts).

## 7) Teacher Control Sequence (Dashboard)
- Stage 1: `clip_a`
- Stage 2: `activity`
- Stage 3: `clip_b`

## 7A) Video Plan (What plays where)
- Clip A (Stage `clip_a`, 2-3 min):
  - "Queue Pressure"
  - Goal: establish pace pressure and `priority` language
- Clip B (Stage `clip_b`, 1-2 min):
  - "Pressure Choice Beat"
  - Goal: sharpen speed-vs-accuracy conflict
- Environment direction:
  - productivity urgency; operational pace and low-level stress

## 8) Full Script

### Clip A - Queue Pressure
PEARL: "Queue volume has doubled. Maintain quality and speed."

BETTY: "High `priority` cases should be processed first, sugar."

IVAN: "If a message is unclear, `clarify` before you approve."

PEARL: "Fast, accurate `dispatch` protects the collective."

BETTY: "A calm associate keeps the `queue` moving."

### In-App Trigger Line
PEARL strip: "Delays increase confusion. Accuracy resolves it."

### Clip B - Pressure Choice Beat
IVAN: "Fast work can hide mistakes."

BETTY: "Confidence matters. Hesitation spreads doubt."

PEARL: "Priority queue updated. Continue to Language Desk."
