Authoring standard:
- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/World_Canon.md`
- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/Script_Writing_Style_Guide.md`

## 1) Weekly Outcomes
By the end of this class, students can:
- Identify one contradiction between two official memos.
- Explain the contradiction using one past sentence and one present sentence.
- Use these new words in context: `contradiction`, `missing`, `notice`, `revision`.

## 2) Semester Outcomes Supported
- Outcome 1: identify key details + implied concern from sources.
- Outcome 2: apply past vs present grammar accurately.
- Outcome 3: reuse weekly vocabulary in output.
- Outcome 4: justify one reporting choice with evidence.

## 3) Story Outcomes
- William sees official records that do not match.
- Betty frames conflict as normal process.
- Ivan shows uncertainty under procedural pressure.

## 4) Character Direction (canon)
- PEARL: calm procedural language; concern is framed as support.
- Betty: warm reframing; never admits institutional fault.
- Ivan: anxious checking behavior; asks "is this okay?"

## 5) Vocabulary + Grammar Lock
- Known words: `today`, `yesterday`, `record`, `check`
- New words: `contradiction`, `missing`, `notice`, `revision`
- Grammar focus:
  - past simple vs present simple
  - `there is/there are` reporting frame

## 6) In-Class Required Flow (50 min)
1. 0-5 min: Shift Start + recap
2. 5-11 min: Broadcast Clip A
3. 11-18 min: Briefing checks (3)
4. 18-30 min: Core Practice (Evidence Desk compare task)
5. 30-36 min: Broadcast Clip B
6. 36-46 min: Production (Filing Desk OR Voice Booth)
7. 46-50 min: Clock-Out + exit ticket

Optional if time: 4-item Language Lab refresh.

## 7) Teacher Control Sequence (Dashboard)
- Stage 1: `clip_a`
- Stage 2: `activity`
- Stage 3: `clip_b`

## 7A) Video Plan (What plays where)
- Clip A (Stage `clip_a`, 2-3 min):
  - "Dispatch Conflict"
  - Goal: show contradictory memos and trigger evidence language
- Clip B (Stage `clip_b`, 1-2 min):
  - "Official Reframe"
  - Goal: normalize contradiction through `revision` framing
- Environment direction:
  - polite procedural calm with visible uncertainty underneath

## 8) Full Script

### Clip A - Dispatch Conflict
PEARL: "Morning dispatch includes Memo 14 and Memo 14-R."

BETTY: "Updates happen because leadership cares about clarity, honey."

IVAN: "Yesterday the memo said one thing. Today it says another."

PEARL: "Identify any `contradiction`. Report only verified differences."

BETTY: "If a line is `missing`, check the latest `revision` before concern."

### In-App Trigger Line (after second check)
PEARL strip: "Associates report differences with calm precision."

### Clip B - Official Reframe
BETTY: "A revised `notice` replaces earlier wording automatically."

IVAN (quiet): "What if the earlier one was true?"

PEARL: "Contradiction report accepted. Continue standard operations."
