# Script Writing Style Guide (Canonical)

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Purpose
This guide defines exactly how we write scripts so they are:
- teachable for Taipei Grade 10 bilingual learners (A2-B1)
- faithful to Lexical Republic world canon
- consistent across all 18 lessons

## Audience Baseline
- Learners: Grade 10, bilingual track, mixed A2-B1 proficiency.
- Class reality: max 50 minutes including setup.
- Writing target: clear, high-frequency English with controlled introduction of new vocabulary.

## Core Writing Style

### Tone
- Surface tone: warm, orderly, polite.
- Hidden tone: controlling, surveilled, slightly unsettling.
- No cartoon villain speeches.
- Harm is framed as "help" by Party voices.

### Sentence Style
- Use short to medium spoken lines.
- Spoken line length target: 6-14 words.
- One idea per line.
- Prefer direct sentence structures over complex clauses.

### Complexity Rules
- Clip dialogue should be easier than activity text.
- At most 1 new target word per line in clip dialogue.
- Avoid stacked unknown vocabulary in one sentence.

## Vocabulary Control Rules

### Known vs New Ratio
- Clip scripts: ~85-90% known/familiar words, ~10-15% target new words.
- Activity instructions: use mostly known words.
- New words are introduced, then repeated in controlled tasks.

### Weekly New Word Limit
- 4-8 new words per week (recommended: 4 for Week 1-3).
- Each new word appears at least 3 times per lesson:
  1. Clip dialogue
  2. Core practice task
  3. Voice or writing output

### Allowed Story Terms (canon-safe)
Use consistently:
- `Prior-1`, `Prior-2`, `Unit`
- `Concern`, `Wellness Assistance`, `Referral`
- `directive`, `protocol`, `clearance`

## Character Voice Rules
- PEARL:
  - friendly, procedural, never openly angry
  - reframes concern as support
- Betty (`Welcome Associate-14`):
  - warm southern style ("sugar", "darlin'")
  - true believer, never ironic
- Ivan (`Clarity Associate-22`):
  - anxious, earnest, seeks reassurance
- M.K. Catskil:
  - short truth-hint lines, dry edge
- William Flannery (`Clarity Associate-7`):
  - earnest internal voice, observant, not cynical

## Banned/Restricted Style Elements
Do not use unless explicitly taught that week:
- idioms and slang-heavy expressions
- culture-specific jokes and wordplay
- dense phrasal-verb chains
- long rhetorical paragraphs in dialogue

## Lesson Script Blueprint (Required)
Every weekly script pack must include:
1. Weekly language outcomes
2. Weekly story outcomes
3. Clip A full script
4. In-app trigger lines
5. Clip B full script
6. Activity checks aligned to script language
7. One core practice block
8. One production block (voice or writing)

## Quality Checklist (Pre-Approval)
Before locking a lesson, verify:
- Every check question maps to a script line.
- New words match the weekly vocabulary list.
- Grammar target appears in both script and activity.
- No line exceeds student readability target.
- 50-minute schedule fits required tasks.

## Next-Step Application
When writing new scripts (Weeks 4+):
- Start from `Dplan/World_Canon.md`
- Apply this style guide first
- Then run vocabulary and grammar checks
