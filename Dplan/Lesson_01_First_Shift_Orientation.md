## 1) Weekly Outcomes
By the end of this class, students can:
- Explain William's new role in 3-4 clear sentences.
- Use present simple + be-verb + basic agreement in onboarding language.
- Use these new words in context: `compliance`, `directive`, `protocol`, `clearance`.

## 2) Semester Outcomes Supported
- Outcome 1: identify main idea + key detail from official media.
- Outcome 2: apply core grammar accurately in context.
- Outcome 3: use weekly vocabulary in controlled output.

## 3) Story Outcomes
- William Flannery becomes `Clarity Associate-7`.
- Betty (`Welcome Associate-14`) establishes warm-but-controlling Ministry culture.
- Ivan (`Clarity Associate-22`) and M.K. offer first subtle warning signals.

## 4) Character Direction (canon)
- PEARL: bright, supportive, procedural; never openly negative.
- Betty: southern warmth, always "helping," never shows doubt.
- Ivan: friendly anxiety, wants to do well, seeks reassurance.
- M.K.: short lines, ironic truth hints, controlled risk.

## 5) Vocabulary + Grammar Lock
- Known words: `work`, `rule`, `team`, `today`
- New words: `compliance`, `directive`, `protocol`, `clearance`
- Grammar focus:
  - present simple
  - be-verb
  - quick review: subject-verb agreement

## 6) In-Class Required Flow (50 min)
1. 0-5 min: Shift Start (objective + word preview)
2. 5-12 min: Broadcast Clip A
3. 12-18 min: Briefing checks (3)
4. 18-28 min: Core Practice (Language Lab short set)

6. 34-44 min: Production (Voice Booth OR Filing Desk)
7. 44-50 min: Clock-Out + exit ticket

## 7) Teacher Control Sequence (Dashboard)
- Stage 1: `clip_a`
- Stage 2: `activity`
- Stage 3: `clip_b`

## 7A) Video Plan (What plays where)
- Clip A (Stage `clip_a`, 2-3 min):
  - "Party Onboarding Broadcast"
  - Goal: establish William's role + teach `directive`, `protocol`, `compliance`
- Clip B (Stage `clip_b`, 1-2 min):
  - "Assignment Confirmation"
  - Goal: reinforce `clearance` + add first tension hook
- Environment direction:
  - bright sterile optimism, highly ordered, calm authority tone

## 8) Full Script

### Clip A - Ministry Onboarding Broadcast
PEARL: "Good morning, Clarity Associate-7. Your shift begins now."

BETTY: "Well now, welcome to the Department of Clarity, sugar. You're right where you belong."

PEARL: "A `directive` is an official order. Follow each `protocol` step exactly."

IVAN: "I started yesterday. Just read twice before you submit. It helps."

PEARL: "Strong `compliance` protects citizens from confusion."

WILLIAM (internal): "This is real. I can do this."

### In-App Trigger Line (after first check)
PEARL strip: "Excellent start. Accurate language creates safe communities."

### Clip B - First Assignment Confirmation
BETTY: "You have temporary `clearance` for your first set of files, darlin'."

M.K. CATSKIL: "Write what you can prove. Not more. Not less."

PEARL: "System stable. Continue to processing."
