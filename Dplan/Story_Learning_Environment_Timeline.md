# Story + Learning + Environment Timeline (18 Shifts)

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Purpose
This is the fixed sequencing map for how each class period uses video, activity, and atmosphere.
It keeps script, gameplay, and language learning on one timeline.

## Fixed Playback Rule (Teacher-Guided)
For every shift:
1. Clip A plays first (`nowShowingStage = clip_a`)
2. Students complete the core activity (`nowShowingStage = activity`)
3. Clip B plays as the reveal/hook (`nowShowingStage = clip_b`)

No free-roam sequence in class delivery.

## Media Upload Rule
- Keep video upload open for all weeks.
- Teacher uploads Clip A and Clip B before class (Canva export or direct file).
- Embed URL can remain as fallback, but upload is the primary path.

## 50-Minute Timing Envelope
- 0-5 min: Shift Start (teacher pre-teach + objective + key words)
- 5-11 min: Clip A
- 11-30 min: Core app activity block
- 30-36 min: Clip B
- 36-46 min: Production block (voice or writing)
- 46-50 min: Clock-Out + exit

## Week-by-Week Timeline Map

| Week | Clip A (Story Setup) | Activity Focus (Language) | Clip B (Story Progress) | Environment Beat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Party onboarding broadcast introduces William and PEARL authority. | Present simple, be-verb, onboarding terms (`directive`, `protocol`). | Assignment confirmation; first subtle unease line. | Sterile, cheerful institutional welcome. |
| 2 | Conflicting memo appears ("14" vs "14-R"). | Past vs present reporting; contradiction language. | Official reframe: revision is "normal." | Slight tension under warm language. |
| 3 | Queue pressure rises; speed rhetoric intensifies. | `can/should`, imperatives, clarification sentence frames. | Choice pressure beat: speed vs accuracy. | Busy operational floor mood. |
| 4 | Evidence fragments introduced as timeline puzzle. | Sequencing words + simple past evidence statements. | One viewed fragment becomes classified. | Archive tone: procedural but suspicious. |
| 5 | Wellness framing language appears as "care." | Emotion adjectives + must/should justification. | Student response flagged for review. | Friendly surveillance tone deepens. |
| 6 | Audit sequence of Act I closes; first arc synthesis. | Multi-skill review (Weeks 1-5 grammar/vocab). | File flashes warning signal. | End-of-act pressure spike. |
| 7 | Hidden lexicon words enter official channels. | Relative clauses + descriptive noun phrases. | Secret note hidden in corrected text. | Beginning of covert resistance signals. |
| 8 | Contradiction protocol escalates into policy conflict. | Contrast language (`however`, `although`), comparatives. | PEARL questions repeated archive access. | Monitoring tone becomes explicit. |
| 9 | Audio intercept introduces tone inference. | Reported speech + inference (`might`, `seems`). | Voice clip names student designation. | Audio paranoia and uncertainty. |
| 10 | Transfer order and new permissions issued. | Process sequencing + conditional `if` statements. | Access granted to restricted space. | Controlled relocation; disorientation. |
| 11 | Missing index/label collapse; Noor worldview enters. | Classification language and precise modifiers. | PEARL offline interruption beat. | Whisper-room warm palette break. |
| 12 | Act II packet submission under elevated monitoring. | Cause/effect connectors (`therefore`, `as a result`). | Badge status shifts to amber. | Open surveillance state. |
| 13 | Public language choices become socially visible. | Opinion + reason clauses for stance taking. | Harmony echoes student language back. | External social pressure emerges. |
| 14 | Directive override creates impossible compliance choice. | Conditionals (`if`, `unless`, `even if`). | PEARL labels response ambiguous. | Fast, unstable system mood. |
| 15 | Drafting and defending public statement. | Formal register + modal certainty levels. | Citizen challenge to authority of speaker. | Public accountability pressure. |
| 16 | Appeal confrontation with Director-7. | Formal connectors for argument structure. | Appeal accepted by unknown signer. | Cold bureaucratic courtroom tone. |
| 17 | Final archive assembly and corroboration. | Complex cohesion + source attribution. | PEARL loops onboarding line back. | Glitching institutional memory. |
| 18 | Final address setup and emotional closure. | Integrated fluency across grammar + vocabulary + persuasion. | Final PEARL line and amber fade. | System dissolves into reflective ending. |

## Video Planning Requirements Per Week
Each week must define all items below before activity writing is finalized:
1. Clip A objective line (what students should understand before activity).
2. Clip A vocabulary targets (max 4-8 new words/week).
3. Activity language objective (grammar + output requirement).
4. Clip B narrative turn (what changes after activity).
5. Environment cue (visual/sound tone direction for class atmosphere).

## Weeks 1-3 Immediate Production Plan

### Week 1
- Clip A: onboarding broadcast, identity assignment, directive/protocol framing.
- Activity: comprehension checks + short grammar control.
- Clip B: clearance granted + first tension hint.
- Environment: clean, bright Ministry confidence.

### Week 2
- Clip A: contradictory memo pair appears.
- Activity: compare documents using past/present evidence sentences.
- Clip B: contradiction is normalized as "revision."
- Environment: procedural calm with subtle distrust.

### Week 3
- Clip A: queue surge and pace pressure messaging.
- Activity: priority decisions with modal justification.
- Clip B: speed-vs-truth tension voiced by Ivan/Betty split.
- Environment: productive urgency.
