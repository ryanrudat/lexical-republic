# Lexical Republic Semester Outcomes Framework

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Program Frame (Grade 10, A2-B1)
- Setting: dystopian Ministry workplace where language is tied to control.
- Delivery: teacher-guided weekly sequence with explicit pacing (`clip_a -> activity -> clip_b`).
- Class constraint: 50 minutes maximum, including setup and pre-teach.
- Canon source for character/world tone:
  - `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Dplan` (Desktop source files)
- Authoring controls:
  - `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/World_Canon.md`
  - `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/Script_Writing_Style_Guide.md`

## End-of-Semester Outcomes (Week 18)
By the end of the semester, students should be able to:

1. Understand controlled media messages and identify main idea + key detail + implied concern.
2. Use core Grade 10 grammar targets (present/past, modals, sequencing, conditionals, evidence language) in context.
3. Use targeted weekly vocabulary accurately in speaking and writing outputs.
4. Ask for clarification, compare conflicting information, and justify choices with evidence.
5. Produce a formal final communication product:
   - Spoken: 2-3 minute final address.
   - Written: 150-220 word final case file with evidence references.

## Assessment Spine
- Weekly micro-evidence:
  - Briefing checks (comprehension)
  - One controlled practice task (grammar/listening)
  - One production task (voice OR writing)
- Arc checkpoints:
  - Week 6 (Act I), Week 12 (Act II), Week 18 (Final)

## Weekly Classroom Pattern (50 min realistic)
This is the default in-class pattern.

1. `Shift Start` (3-5 min): settle + objective + key vocabulary preview.
2. `Broadcast` (12-15 min): Clip A, guided check, Clip B.
3. `Core Practice` (12-15 min): one main app task (Language Lab OR Evidence Desk).
4. `Production` (10-12 min): Voice Booth OR Filing Desk.
5. `Clock-Out` (3-5 min): exit check + next hook.

## 3-Week Alignment Snapshot (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: First Shift Orientation
- Weekly language outcome:
  - Introduce role language with present simple, be-verb, and basic modals.
- Weekly story outcome:
  - Students enter The Party system and accept first assignment while sensing subtle unease.
- Semester outcomes supported: 1, 2, 3.

### Week 2: The Memo That Wasn't There
- Weekly language outcome:
  - Compare present vs past records and describe contradictions.
- Weekly story outcome:
  - Students encounter official inconsistency and practice reporting without open defiance.
- Semester outcomes supported: 1, 2, 3, 4.

### Week 3: Clarity Bay Intake
- Weekly language outcome:
  - Use can/should and polite clarification during time pressure.
- Weekly story outcome:
  - Students feel production pressure and start making value-based processing choices.
- Semester outcomes supported: 1, 2, 3, 4.

## Character Function Rules (for script writing)
- PEARL: ambient authority; friendly surveillance; procedural language.
- Betty (`Welcome Associate-14`): warm southern voice, true believer, normalizes control as care.
- Ivan (`Clarity Associate-22`): cohort buddy, anxious, seeks clarity through rules.
- M.K. Catskil: edge-walker truth hints, sparse line delivery.
- William Flannery (`Clarity Associate-7`): earnest learner-proxy.

## Build Guardrails
- Do not add extra activities until script, vocab, and grammar targets are approved.
- Every activity must trace to one weekly language outcome.
- Keep required in-class tasks to 3-4 actions max due 50-minute limit.
