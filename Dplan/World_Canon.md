# World Canon - The Lexical Republic

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Canon Source
This file is the canonical world summary for script writing.
Derived from Desktop Dplan source files:
- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Dplan/docs/world-building.md`
- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Dplan/docs/characters.md`
- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Dplan/docs/narrative.md`
- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Dplan/docs/locations.md`
- `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Dplan/docs/scripts/day-0-7-scripts.md`

## 1) Setting
- Nation: The Lexical Republic.
- Origin myth: founded after the "Babel Collapse."
- Core doctrine: controlled language prevents chaos.
- Main institution: Ministry of Healthy and Safe Information.

## 2) Regime Principles (Never Contradict)
1. The Party above all (self, family, truth).
2. Control through comfort, not visible violence.
3. Language control through approved/proscribed terms.
4. Collective above the individual.

## 3) Tone of the World
- Cheerful dystopia.
- Visual softness, institutional warmth, procedural cruelty.
- Citizens are spoken to like they are being cared for.
- Fear is mostly administrative, not theatrical.

## 4) Social Language System
- Public identity uses designation, not personal name.
- Family words are replaced:
  - `family` -> `Unit`
  - `mother/father` -> `Prior-1/Prior-2`
- Compliance system uses:
  - `Concern`
  - `Wellness Assistance`
  - `Referral`

## 5) PEARL Canon
- Name: PEARL (public-facing AI).
- Hidden expansion: Protective Evaluation and Attitude Regulation Liaison.
- Style: always friendly, always present, always evaluative.
- Function: guidance + surveillance + behavioral framing.
- Rule: PEARL does not "snap" emotionally in early arc; pressure appears in wording and frequency.

## 6) Character Canon (Core Cast)

### William Flannery
- Designation: `Clarity Associate-7`
- Starting state: genuine believer, earnest, observant.
- Story role: student proxy; learns grammar while uncovering contradiction.

### Betty
- Designation: `Welcome Associate-14`
- Voice: warm southern, maternal, supportive.
- Core truth: true believer; frames reporting as care.
- Story role: kindness + control in one person.

### Ivan
- Designation: `Clarity Associate-22`
- Voice: friendly, anxious, eager to do right.
- Story role: cohort mirror; follows rules for safety and belonging.

### M.K. Catskil
- Veteran associate; truth-edge commentator.
- Voice: short, sharp, controlled risk.
- Story role: subtle warning channel.

### Chad (later arc use)
- Connected underperformer; removal catalyst.

## 7) Location Canon (Class-Relevant)
- Clarity Bay: main work floor, editing + moderation loop.
- Welcome Desk: social warmth + procedural gatekeeping.
- Broadcast channel: official framing.
- Wellness language appears as support, not punishment.

## 8) Week 1-3 Story Arc Canon

### Week 1
- Entry, onboarding, role acceptance, first subtle unease.

### Week 2
- Contradictory records appear; language of revision normalizes inconsistency.

### Week 3
- Queue pressure rises; students choose between speed and verification.

## 9) Canon Guardrails for Script Team
- Keep names/designations consistent.
- Keep world terms consistent (`Unit`, `Prior`, `Concern`, `Wellness`).
- Keep Party speech warmly controlling.
- Do not introduce new lore that conflicts with this file without explicit canon update.

## 10) Canon Update Rule
If a new script introduces new world facts, update this file first, then lesson files.
