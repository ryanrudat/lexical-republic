# Script and Vocabulary Build Order (Canonical)

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Core Rule
Write and approve in this exact order:

1. Weekly language outcome
2. Weekly story outcome
3. Weekly media plan (Clip A purpose, activity bridge, Clip B reveal, environment cue)
4. Full script (Clip A, in-app line triggers, Clip B)
5. Vocabulary list (known vs new)
6. Grammar targets
7. Activities (checks + one core practice + one production task)

If an activity is not tied to the approved script and weekly outcome, do not include it.

## 50-Minute Class Rule (to prevent overload)
Use this required structure each week:

1. `Shift Start` (3-5 min)
2. `Broadcast` with teacher control: `clip_a -> activity -> clip_b` (12-15 min)
3. One `Core Practice` block (12-15 min)
4. One `Production` block: Voice Booth OR Filing Desk (10-12 min)
5. `Clock-Out` and exit ticket (3-5 min)

Optional blocks only if time remains.

## Activity Roles by Area
- Shift Start: objective + quick retrieval
- Broadcast: story + comprehension checks
- Language Lab: grammar control
- Evidence Desk: source comparison / proof
- Voice Booth: spoken output
- Filing Desk: written output

## Week 1-3 Canon Package

- Writing style and vocabulary controls:
  - `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/Script_Writing_Style_Guide.md`

- Source integration notes:
  - `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/Dplay_Source_Integration_Notes.md`

## Character Use Rule
Keep character behavior stable:
- PEARL = procedural authority
- Betty = warm true believer (care-language + control)
- Ivan = anxious cohort buddy, seeks safety in rules
- M.K. = truth-framed elder line
- William Flannery = student proxy perspective

## Build Rule for Teacher-Guided Runtime
For each week briefing config:
- `nowShowingStage`: `clip_a` -> `activity` -> `clip_b`
- `videoSource`: `auto`
- Use Clip A/B upload slots first, embed links as fallback
- Keep teacher video upload open for both clip slots every week.

## Script Authoring Input Order (Now Mandatory)
1. Read `World_Canon.md`.
2. Read `Script_Writing_Style_Guide.md`.
3. Read `Story_Learning_Environment_Timeline.md`.
4. Lock weekly known/new words.
5. Write script draft.
6. Build activities only after script lock.
