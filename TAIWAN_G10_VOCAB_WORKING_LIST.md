# Taiwan Grade 10 Vocabulary Working List

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## Working Assumption
- Target group: Taipei Grade 10 bilingual students (A2-B1).
- Script writing uses a two-list model each week:
  - `Known words` = likely familiar words.
  - `New words` = 4-8 focus words introduced and recycled in tasks.
- Story language references should remain canon-safe:
  - `Prior-1`, `Unit`, `Concern`, `Wellness Assistance`, `directive`, `protocol`.
- Full style rules are defined in:
  - `/Users/ryanrudat/Desktop/Lexical Republic/Dplan/Script_Writing_Style_Guide.md`

## National Baseline (Reference)
- Grade 10-11 focus is commonly taught/tested within the first 4 levels (about 4,500 words).
- CEEC also publishes a larger 6-level reference list (about 6,000 words).

## Recycle Rule
Within the same class, each new word should appear at least 3 times:
